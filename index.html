        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, My name is Amalia Rodriguez Fabian, a second-year Education Major of the University of California, Riverside. I am currently taking most of my breath requirements and every quarter I liked to take at least have one Education class to completed some of my upper-division classes. So far, I took Intro to Education 005 that provided general information and what looks to be in the field. Another class was Intro to Education Policy that mostly focuses on how the law in Education works, the movements and rights that had led all communities to be able to study. Lastly, I am taking Intro to Special Education that's mainly where I want to focus is the most because my interested in this major started when I decided I wanted to work with Special Ed kids. I feel connected with this through my  personal experience and that's why I want to give it back to my community and all those kids that just required more time than I regular one. My passion to work with kids has grown in the last few years with all the volunteer opportunities I have done in my volunteer programs. <br><br>

        I have been involved with school organizations such as Keystone for the 2 years until now and a leadership class, most of the activities that we realized involved our community but we focused on the young generations. I begin working this year as a Team Staff at my school that needs to be done after school ends, also I have a part-time job at Century 20 Daly City during the weekends. Though the last summer, I participated in an internship called: Peer Health Educator. <br><br>

        Therefore, I would like to become a Special Ed Teacher, I became interested in this field because when I came to the U.S. I felt like a new baby was born and had difficulties to engage with its community, and I could go through all this with the help I received from my teachers and classmates. And I enjoy helping others because seems the smile on other people's faces, makes me happy. I came to the U.S. to fulfill my parent's dream, graduating from college and don't repeat the same mistakes as them. Also for all my family members who supported me throughout my childhood and have high expectations in my future. They inspired me to fight to receive the best education possible, and no matter the obstacles I will face because the reward will be greater. Even Though my life experience has been the most amazing or beautiful as other kids, it makes me value more everything and everyone who is around me that had been teaching me real-life struggles that I will face and I don't have to be afraid of it. I want to be a role model for young generations that they can feel comfortable relying on me because of what they see of me, not from what they have been told. My community is a big part of my life because they had been there at the worst time of my life, and I feel that working with them is a way I can pay them back.
